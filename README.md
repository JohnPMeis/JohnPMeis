What's up my Glip Glops!!  
Welcome to GitHub Dimension C-137.  
I will be your Rick err... Host, for this repository.  
I am currently pursusing my degree in Cybersecurity @ Collin College.  
I have so far been able to accomplich my Cisco CCNA, CCST, and Splunk User certifications.  
I have a side hustle where I like to make things with my laser cutter but not motivated enough to make a storefront for it.  
Thats a little about me, if you're here then you must be curious about me, so feel free to explore.
